Housing Data

The project aims to leverage data-driven insights to better understand housing market trends, predict property prices, and provide valuable information for potential home buyers 
and real estate investors.By harnessing the power of data analytics using R, we intend to see how thehousing landscape has changed over the last five years. 
Along the way, we also want to provide actionable information by answering the below questions: 
• Which Iowa counties have the highest and lowest property values? 
• How have property values changed over time? 
• What counties are similar based on some of the variables we used?
• How well does median income predict median housing value and vice versa? 
• Does the racial makeup of a county affect the median housing value in that area?
